	<h2>Interests and Goals</h2>
	<p>I am a graduate from UC Berkeley with double majors in Molecular Environmental Biology and Geography. While in college I found that most of my academic interest aligned with environmental sciences and geospatial information science. That is why I am working towards a career working for a federal, state, or regional agency that works with conserving the environment using tools like GIS.</p>
	<h2>Club Memberships</h2>
	<p>Currently not a member of any club/organization.</p>
	<h2>Work Experience</h2>
	<p>For work experience I have been working in accounting and admin for 2 years at a grocery store. Additionally I have 2 years experience working in food service as a dishwasher, server, cleaner, and shift lead.</p>
